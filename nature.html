                The idea of ‘nature’ is at the very core of science, considered as its flagship and deepest link with human societies. However, while nature preservation has become a major social concern, the idea of nature remains elusive. We examine here the origins, etymology, and historical semantics of this word and 
                 its different meanings in contemporary European languages.
                 It appears that this word aggregated successively different and sometimes conflicting meanings throughout its history. One of the main present occidental meanings of “nature”, designating what is opposed to humans, currently used in public policies, conservation science, or environmental ethics,
                 hence appears rare and recent, and contradictory with most other visions of nature, including former European representations and contemporary foreign ones. Nature preservation ought to take into account this semantic diversity when proposing policies, integrating the relativity and potential inaccuracy of the currently dominating occidental definition.

            <p>Since at least the 1970s, a wide scientific, political, and public consensus has emerged about the crucial necessity of “protecting nature” (Worster, 1994). Since early whistle-blowers such as John Muir or Rachel Carson to the theorization of a whole scientific discipline coined as “conservation biology” (Soulé, 1985), the conservation of nature has reached both wide popular concern and scientific maturity. Intense debates, significant thinkers and prominent scientific advances have made this field one of the most important socially in contemporary science, having a strong influence on national and international politics. However, the appealing concept of “nature” has never been really theorized during all this time, and has been used to name more and more diverse things, as well as their opposite, 
                
                at the risk of becoming another meaningless panchreston (Simberloff, 2014). As scientific knowledge of nature is (and will always remain) incomplete, scientists have to rely on mental representations and theoretical concepts, but these must be identified as such, and clearly defined (Demeritt, 2002). Many close and successful new technical words have been born in the same lexical field, such as “ecosystem”, “biodiversity”, “biosphere”, and even “Gaia”, but none of them ever really supplanted “nature”, even in scientific literature, and it is still the title of one of the most important scientific journals. However, “nature” is not such an easy word, and it actually fits the definition of an abstract concept, hence a mental construction rather than a concrete notion, which is situated both historically
                
                and geographically, and needs definition in context (Ellen, 1996), just like what has been done about “wilderness” (Rolston III, 1997, Callicott & Nelson, 1998, Callicott, 2008a) or more recently about the idea of a “balance [of nature]” (Simberloff, 2014).

                Hence, studying the concept of “nature” itself and its relationship with practical objects and social projects is crucial for conservation sciences and derived policies: many linguists, philosophers, and historians have already shown that its meaning is far from being unified or self-evident (Larrère and Larrère, 2015), but such works have had little popularization in biological sciences so far. Nevertheless, these works have already stressed out that the word “nature” is very difficult to define, and has gone through many changes of meaning during its history (Lenoble, 1969). Moreover, some punctual studies showed that, as for “wilderness” (Callicott, 2000), the word “nature” does not always have a translation in other languages (Philippe Descola, 2005), or can embody different meanings within a language.
                
                In this study, we analyze the origins and evolution of the word “nature” in European languages, from its ancient Greek equivalent to Latin and then to modern meanings, showing that this word, already deemed vague and ambiguous since its most ancient uses, overwhelmingly changed in meaning several times in its history, which is at the basis of its current vagueness and ambiguity. Such ambiguity may constitute the very source of many raging debates among ecologists, such as the “balance of nature” debate (Simberloff, 2014) and many others. As a conslusion, we compare the semantic clusters stemming from these analyses with the contemporary scientific vision of nature in conservation science, in order to see how this semantic diversity can be an obstacle or a chance for the global conservation of “nature”.

                 <p>Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth.
                   <b> What Nature gives us?</b>
                   <br>
                    Nature provides us with water, clean air and food, and raw materials for medicines, industry and buildings. Our crops rely on insect pollination and the complex biological processes that create soil. Enjoying parks, landscapes and wildlife improves our health and well-being.

                    Our forests, rivers, oceans and soils provide us with the food we eat, the air we breathe, the water we irrigate our crops with. We also rely on them for numerous other goods and services we depend on for our health, happiness and prosperity.

                    The natural world is an incredible wonder that inspires us all. It underpins our economy, our society, indeed our very existence. Our forests, rivers, oceans and soils provide us with the food we eat, the air we breathe, the water we irrigate our crops with.
                     We also rely on them for numerous other goods and services we depend on for our health, happiness and prosperity.

                     <h3><b>beauty of nature</b></h3>
                     What is the first thing that comes to mind when you think about the beauty of nature? Greenery, Right? But the beauty of nature is more than the greenery. Everything you feel and see around, including Mountains, Forests, Rivers, Birds, Plants, Animals, Air, etc. – all are a part of the beauty of nature.

                      Nature is the lifeblood of all living creatures in the world. Nature provides us with everything (like Food, Water, Shelter, etc.), which we need to sustain and survive in the long run.
                      We, humans, are also a part of nature, but we tend to distinguish ourselves from nature and do the things, which may harm the nature.

                      Respect nature and its resources, show some compassion towards it. It is the responsibility of a human being to protect nature. We, as humans, should refrain from doing any harm to nature if we need to provide a good natural environment to the future generations.  
                      
                      To sum it up, in a nutshell, the below quote from Charles Darwin defines it well.  
                      
                      “Everything, what is against nature, will not last for long.” – Charles Darwin

                      <h3><b>Significance of Nature</b></h3>
                      <br>
                      <hr>
                     The significance of nature cannot be overemphasized because the things nature provides to us are not replaceable by modern technology in any way. 

                       For example, let us compare the effects of natural food and the food we eat in a modern lifestyle. The food we eat today (not all the food we eat is bad,
                        but most of it anyway like junk and oil foods) is causing various serious health issues like obesity, heart diseases, etc. On the other hand, eating natural foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, etc. 
                       are scientifically proven health and can help you to live a long and beautiful life.

                     Each and everything in nature, including living or non-living organisms, play an important role in maintaining the balance to create a viable environment for all of us, which is called ecological balance. 
                     We need to make sure that the ecological balance should be maintained at all times to avoid a catastrophic situation in the future.

                    <h4> <b>Types of Natural Resources:</b></h4>
                    
                     Natural resources can be classified into two types namely

                     Renewable resources
                     Non-Renewable resources
                     1. Renewable Resources:
                         Renewable Resources are the resources which are constantly available or easily replaced or reproduced.

                      For example, land, water are easily available.  Vegetables and fruits can be easily produced. 

                      Renewable Sources are of two types 

                     Organic Renewable Resources: Which comes from living things like plants and animals.
                     In-Organic Renewable Resources: Which comes from non-living things like water, light, wind, etc
                     <br>
                     <hr> 
                     2. Non-Renewable Resources
                        Non-renewable resources are the resources that cannot be available after they are depleted. They are limited in terms of availability.
                        
                      Some examples include fossil fuels and minerals.

                      <br>
                           There are plenty of natural resources that are available on earth, and we should use them in an optimum manner. If we start to exploit and deplete the resources available, then the resources might become scarce.

                     So we must conserve nature and its resources in such a manner that the future generations can be benefited from them. Conservation of natural resources should also be done for environmental protection. 

                     One of the several reasons for the depletion of resources is an increase in the human population. Taking precautionary measures to control the population is essential for nature to retain its essence. Before we learn about how to conserve nature, let’s understand what is the conservation of nature.
